Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Class Schedule
--------------

The schedule (see {{% resource_link e8af783d-31be-1fe1-9d71-670be1c259f0 "calendar" %}}) shows the reading you should have done by a given day: it's designed to spread your reading fairly evenly across the semester (e.g., if four class sessions are devoted to a novel, you should read at least a quarter of the novel for each of those sessions). In class, however, I'll go slower over some parts, faster over others.

Student Work
------------

1.  A take-home essay exam (1 or 2 questions) after each of the first five novels.  
    
2.  One or two oral reports, approx. 10 minutes each.

Guidelines
----------

1.  No more than two unexcused absences. Beyond that, you will fail the course.
    *   If you are sick or have to be away for another legitimate reason, e-mail me.
    *   I may charge you an unexcused absence if you frequently arrive late or without your book.  
        
2.  Unannounced quizzes on readings at my discretion.
